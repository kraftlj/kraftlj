## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Director of Research and Development with over 10 years of experience leading teams. I hold 20 patents in the DNA sequencing space and was part of the teams at Illumina that developed the iSeq100, NextSeq2000, and NovaSeqX DNA sequencing systems. 

I'm currently working with Tempus AI developing molecular diagnostics and AI technology for use in precision medicine. I'm passionate about contributing to products that make the world a better place.

A fun fact about me is that I have a deep knowledge of physical chemistry and mathematical modeling of complex systems. People are often surprised to learn I am a functional programmer in several languages such as C, Python, and SQL. And in the past, I wrote C scripts that produced the nanowell layouts for NovaSeqX and NextSeq2000 flowcells. I also wrote a script that quantifies the levels of index hopping, which is part of the standard output of every Illumina sequencing run.

In addition to my continuous thirst for knowledge, I also enjoy sharing with the members of my research team everything I know!
